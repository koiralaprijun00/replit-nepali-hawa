OpenWeather API Integration Strategy:
Data Mapping for Visualizations:
javascriptOpenWeather Response → App Features:
├── current.pollution.list[0].components → Pollutant breakdown
├── current.pollution.list[0].main.aqi → Current AQI  
├── forecast.pollution.list → 24h/7d trends
├── current.weather → Weather correlation
└── city coordinates → Map visualization
Implementation Priority:
Phase 1 (Week 1-2):

Add favorites management screen
Implement basic trend graphs (24h)
Set up morning/evening notification scheduler

Phase 2 (Week 3-4):

Build comparison tools
Add pollutant breakdown charts
Implement weekly trend alerts

Phase 3 (Week 5-6):

Advanced activity-based notifications
Monthly trend analysis
Personalization based on health profiles

User Testing Approach:

A/B Test: Notification timing preferences (6 AM vs 7 AM)
Usability Test: Favorites management flow with 10 Nepali users
Data Validation: Compare OpenWeather data with local monitoring stations
Feedback Loop: In-app feedback for notification usefulness

This integration plan focuses on seamless user experience while leveraging your existing OpenWeather API infrastructure. Each feature builds upon your current architecture without requiring major rewrites.
