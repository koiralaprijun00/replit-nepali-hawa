Title:
Design a clean, modern, and user-friendly mobile app UI for monitoring air quality and weather data in cities of Nepal using OpenWeather API.

1. Objective:
Build an app that displays real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) and weather data.

Primary focus: Air quality metrics (AQI, pollutants, health recommendations).

Secondary focus: Weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, forecast).

Audience: General public who need quick, reliable air quality data.

2. Design Guidelines:
Visual Style:
Clean, minimal, and flat design (inspired by iOS and modern Android apps).

Soft gradients and color-coded AQI levels for easy recognition.

Rounded cards, sufficient white space, and easy-to-read typography.

Consistent iconography for weather and air quality elements.

Color Palette:
Use AQI color standards (Green = Good, Yellow = Moderate, Orange = Unhealthy for sensitive groups, Red = Unhealthy, Purple = Very Unhealthy, Maroon = Hazardous).

Neutral or light backgrounds for readability.

Weather data in softer complementary colors.

3. Key Screens:
A. Home Screen (City Overview)
Display a list of major cities of Nepal with:

City name, AQI number, status (Good/Moderate/Unhealthy), main pollutant.

Temperature and weather icon.

Card layout with AQI-based background colors.

Option to favorite cities for quick access.

A top search bar for finding other locations.

B. City Detail Screen
Prominent AQI number and status at the top.

Air quality breakdown: PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, NO2, SO2.

Weather data: temperature, wind speed, humidity, pressure.

Health recommendations (based on AQI level).

Hourly and 7-day forecast charts (AQI & weather trends).

C. Map View (Optional)
Interactive map showing air quality levels by city or monitoring station.

D. Alerts/Notification Screen
Push notification settings for unhealthy air quality levels.

4. UX Flow:
Simple navigation with bottom tab bar: Home, Map, Forecast, Notifications, Settings.

Quick switch between favorites and all cities.

Easy access to detailed pollutant info and health tips.

5. Data & Functionality:
OpenWeather API: Air pollution endpoint for AQI & pollutant levels.

Weather endpoint: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, forecasts.

Real-time refresh with caching for offline access.

6. Typography & Icons:
Use Google Fonts (e.g., Roboto or Inter) for readability.

Weather icons (sun, rain, cloud, wind) should be simple and line-based.

AQI icons (face masks, lungs, etc.) optional but helpful.

7. Inspirations (based on provided images):
Card-based layout from IQAir app.

Color-coded AQI categories like AirVisual.

Minimal gradients and soft transitions like Netatmo Healthy Home Coach app (image 1).

8. Deliverables:
Full UI kit with color codes, typography, and icon pack.

High-fidelity mockups for Android & iOS.

Optionally, interactive prototype showing transitions and animations.
